## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a strong grasp of using react and rendering data. I feel confident I can achieve MVP as well as Post-MVP.

### Weaknesses:

I tend to get caught up in styling inbetween writing actual code and rendering it onto the page. I want to make sure I keep on task and come back to the finishing touches of styling at the end.
I also am not too confident in media query just yet.

### Opportunities:

I have the opportunity to use an actual company and present a fun way of interacting with new agents.

### Threats:

Time is important. We are in project week during a holiday and family time is very important to me. I want to make sure I am staying on my timeline to deploy as well as present in a timely manner.
